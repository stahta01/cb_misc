Using a PCH properly under Windows MinGW GGC and Linux GCC

I.  Required rules for using CB PCH properly
    A. CB Project rules
       1. Should have "-Winvalid-pch" warning set.
       2. Must have the folder containing sdk.h and sdk.h.gch in the search path!
         NOTE: The search for the folder containing sdk.h.gch must before the sdk.h search folder.
    B. Source file rules
       1. The sdk_common.h file should only be included by sdk.h and sdk_precomp.h
       2. Use sdk.h instead of sdk_precomp.h in CB Plugins

II. Strongly suggested rules for using CB PCH properly
    A. CB Project rules
        1. Have the PCH options at the target level except when
            a. The project is creating a PCH file.
            b. The option is the PCH warning "-Winvalid-pch"
        2. Define NOPCH when the target is NOT using PCH
    B.  Source file rules
        1. Do NOT include these headers inside normal headers
            a. wx.h
            b. wxprec.h
            c. sdk.h
        2. Do NOT use these pragmas inside normal headers
            a. hdrstop
        3. Do NOT use these pragmas before sdk.h include
            a. implementation
            b. interface
        4. Do NOT include other headers before sdk.h include

III.Suggested rules for using CB PCH properly


Things that fail when using a PCH properly under Windows MinGW GCC
   1. Have CB set to put PCH in object directly fails to work
      if pch file in compiler working folder
      it reads the normal header file instead

Required rules for using CB PCH properly under Windows MinGW GCC
   3. Do NOT include wx.h inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
   4. Do NOT include sdk.h from inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
   5. Do NOT include wxprec.h inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
   6. Do NOT include a header file before include sdk.h.
   6. Do NOT do a pragma before include sdk.h.
   8. Should have "-Winvalid-pch" warning set.
   10.When using CB_PRECOMP in a c++ non header file; include the correct PCH before it.

Suggested rules for using PCH properly under Windows
   1. Use "sdk.h" instead of <sdk.h> (I think PCH files should be in double quotes.)
   2. Try to avoid using CB_PRECOMP or WX_PRECOMP inside headers.
   3. Define CB_PRECOMP for sdk.h; do NOT define WX_PRECOMP as a Compiler command line option.
   4. Define WX_PRECOMP if wanted in sdk_common.h.
   5. After including sdk.h; Do use CB_PRECOMP to guard includes of headers included by the sdk.h PCH.
   6. After including sdk.h; Do use WX_PRECOMP to guard includes of headers included by the wxprec.h but not by sdk.h PCH.
   7. Maybe have the include of sdk.h guarded by macro suggested example below
      #ifndef SDK_H
      #endif // #ifndef SDK_H

Priority order to check PCH rules
   1. This sdk_common.h file should only be included by sdk.h and sdk_precomp.h
   2. Check src/include for issues
      A. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside header files.
      B. Do NOT include wx/wxprec.h from inside header files except for the sdk_common.h file.
      C. Do NOT have #pragma hdrstop in header file except for the sdk_common.h file.
      D. Do NOT include sdk.h or sdk_precomp.h inside the CB include folder.
      Needed to create and test a seperate patch to fix debuggermanager.h and xtra_res.h
      ToDo: created patch for debuggermanager.h
   3. Check src/sdk for issues
      A. Do NOT include sdk.h; instead include sdk_precomp.h inside the CB sdk folder.
      B. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from source files except for wxpropgrid, wxscintilla, and other sub-folders.
      The files scrollingdialog.cpp and xtra_res.cpp violant these rules.
      ToDo: Create patch for scrollingdialog.cpp and xtra_res.cpp
   4. Check src/plugins/scriptedwizard/resources for issues
      A. Do NOT have #pragma hdrstop in header file (unless that header is making a PCH).
      B. Do NOT include sdk.h from inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
      C. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
      D. Do NOT include wx/wxprec.h from inside header files (unless that header is making a PCH).
   5. Check src/src for issues
      A. Do NOT include sdk_precomp.h; instead include sdk.h inside the CB src folder.
      B. Do NOT have #pragma hdrstop in header file.
      C. Do NOT include sdk.h from inside header files.
      D. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside header files.
      E. Do NOT include wx/wxprec.h from inside header files.
      F. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside source files.
      ToDo: Fix switcherdlg.cpp, ipc.h, app.h, scriptconsole.h, and virtualbuildtargetsdlg.h
   6. Check src/plugins for issues
      A. Do NOT include sdk_precomp.h; instead include sdk.h inside a CB plugin folder.
      B. Do NOT have #pragma hdrstop in header file.
      C. Do NOT include sdk.h from inside header files.
      D. Do NOT include wx/wx.h from inside header files.
      E. Do NOT include wx/wxprec.h from inside header files.
