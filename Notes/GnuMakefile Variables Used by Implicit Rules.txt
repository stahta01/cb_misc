AS    Program for compiling assembly files; default ‘as’.
CC    Program for compiling C programs; default ‘cc’.
CXX   Program for compiling C++ programs; default ‘g++’.
CPP   Program for running the C preprocessor, with results to standard output; default ‘$(CC) -E’.
RM    Command to remove a file; default ‘rm -f’. 

ASFLAGS  Extra flags to give to the assembler (when explicitly invoked on a ‘.s’ or ‘.S’ file).
CFLAGS   Extra flags to give to the C compiler.
CXXFLAGS Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler.
CPPFLAGS Extra flags to give to the C preprocessor and programs that use it (the C and Fortran compilers).
LDFLAGS  Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker, ‘ld’, such as -L. Libraries (-lfoo) should be added to the LDLIBS variable instead.
LDLIBS   Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker, ‘ld’. LOADLIBES is a deprecated (but still supported) alternative to LDLIBS. Non-library linker flags, such as -L, should go in the LDFLAGS variable.
